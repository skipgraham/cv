For many years I have been a business strategy professional, once focused on strategic initiatives that helped businesses grow and thrive mainly in the area of talent talent acquisition and leadership. Since 2016, I've returned to my passion in hands-on  technology and software engineering where I have the opportunity to build tangible products that solve problems. While I try to remain technology agnostic, I have fallen in love with iOS mobile app development and the large ecosystem around it. In my current role I have latitude to conjure ideas, create products, and bring them to life, while working with a great team.

Other work includes web development: HTML/CSS, .js, AWS, Firebase. 15+ years of dev experience over a vast sea of OS, platforms, systems, languages, and applications. Consultant to many Fortune 500 companies as technical adviser, engineer, mentor and educator.

I've led key initiatives in multiple regions across the US including San Francisco Bay Area, Northern Virginia/DC, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Denver, St. Louis, and Boston. Have also worked with international entities in Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Montreal and Frankfurt.

Specialties: product management, project management, mobile development, iOS, Swift, AWS, technology integration, process improvement. Well-versed in prototyping, wireframing, UI/UX and backend technologies.
